# The aim of this package is to :
# - launch glances to get a nice UI on whats happening on the system
# - launch a monitoring process to keep track of the colos system ( with maybe extra interface processes )
# - report machine usage via colosstat
# - notify when colossafe cannot guarantee code safety and trigger recovery
# -



# Note : IPC is done with lowlevel python code, we want to minimize dependencies for monitoring and basic implementation
