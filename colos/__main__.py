# Process structure :


# - glances  # providing a useful view of the system, yet we do not want to rely on it for anything else than view
# - heart:   # doing one thing only : checking that colos stays alive L1 : OS process check L2 : IPC message
# - colos:   #Â parent of all colos process. keeps heart alive by aggressive restart.
#   - colosmntr    # replying to heart L2 IPC, and detecting catastrophic failures in colos processes
#   - colosstat    # persisting and sending usage statistics. even on crash...
#   - colossfbx    # implementing safe dynamic functional programming.
